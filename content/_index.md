The cult of 1hive is a role playing game where players work together to understand and realize the true potential of the Dao of Honey.

Players pledge to act with integrity, participate with only a single identity, and to help each other and 1Hive to thrive.Â 

Players can become acolytes, who use their knowledge and influence to guide others. Or they may become builders, who contribute their time and energy to help the community grow. The players who choose to do both are revered as Sages and gain access to 1Hive's inner sanctum.
