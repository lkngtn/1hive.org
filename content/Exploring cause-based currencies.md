Money is fundamentally a social construct, its is valuable because we believe it is valuable. In the past it has been difficult to establish a currency, with the most successful currencies being FIAT currencies backed by highly stable governments. 

However, Bitcoin introduced an alternative to FIAT currency that has proven to be remarkably resilient, and since then countless numbers of cryptocurrencies have been created. Obviously most of these currencies are of dubious value, and most won't be culturally relevant or valuable in the future. 

Still in a world where anyone can create a currency, how might we decide which ones are valuable and which ones are not?

Bitcoin has succeeded primarily because it has cultivated a community around a set of shared values related to trust minimization. It has offered an alternative to FIAT currency that feels more fair (at least to some), where total issuance is capped. People hold Bitcoin as a speculative investment, but they also deeply identify with the community's values, they see themselves as part of a social movement. They organize meetups all across the globe, they contribute to the development of Bitcoin, they market and promote its adoption. 

Ethereum has succeeded primarily by creating a better version of Bitcoin. It shares many of the same values, but the vision for Ethereum has fostered a much less conservative culture. The Ethereum network is more flexible and more scalable and allows its community to build just about anything on top of it using smart contracts. If the Bitcoin community aspires to be Digital Gold, the Ethereum community aspires to become an entire decentralized financial system. Again people hold Ether as a speculative investment, but they also do so out of a desire to see the vision of Ethereum realized. 

As cryptocurrencies continue to proliferate and the technology becomes more accessible and more useful. We hope to see preferences for holding and using various currencies as a means of social signaling. A form of collective action where we bet on a future where others share our values, and work together to make that future a reality. 

[[honey is money|Honey]] might succeed if people care enough about the 1Hive community, if they share its values, and want to see those values spread. [[An overview of the 1Hive DAO protocol|The 1Hive DAO protocol]] is intended to facilitate the advancement of our [[1Hive community covenant|community covenant]] and all you have to do to support the cause is to buy, hold, and use Honey.
