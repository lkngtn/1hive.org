**Honey is how we coordinate around shared values — and share in the value we create.**

1Hive is more than just a community — it's an evolving economic system. To support a future that is more **free**, **fair**, **open**, and **humane**, we need ways to recognize contributions, fund public goods, and align incentives over the long term.

Honey is our way of doing that.

### A Currency for Collective Value

**Honey (HNY)** is a digital currency issued and governed by the 1Hive community. But more importantly, it’s a shared resource: something we choose to value, use, and steward together.

By collectively treating Honey as:

- **A medium of exchange** — used for tipping, rewarding contributions, and exchanging goods and services within the community
- **A store of value** — whose scarcity is preserved through limited issuance and long-term stewardship

...we create a **positive feedback loop**: the more useful and trusted Honey becomes, the more value it can hold — and the more powerfully it can fund our shared goals.

### Building Economic Gravity

Honey’s value isn’t imposed — it’s cultivated.  
Every time we use Honey to:

- Reward meaningful work
- Fund collective infrastructure
- Support each other
- Launch aligned initiatives

...we strengthen its legitimacy and utility.

As more people accept Honey, earn it, and hold it with confidence, it becomes easier to coordinate large-scale efforts without relying on external funding or centralized gatekeepers.

### Long-Term Incentives

Honey is scarce by design. Issuance is limited and governed by the community, ensuring that supply decisions reflect collective interest — not profit-maximizing extraction.

This scarcity, combined with growing utility and active use, supports Honey’s role as a **store of value**. And because Honey is held and used by the same people who help build the ecosystem, its growth is a **shared upside** — not a private one.

Honey allows us to build an economy that works for us — one where value flows toward public goods, creative collaboration, and long-term thinking.

**The more we use it to support what we care about, the more valuable it becomes.**
