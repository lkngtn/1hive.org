Honey is an attempt at building a cryptocurrency that better aligns with our communities collective values. 

Rather than issuance going to block producers as in Proof or Work or Proof of Stake based cryptocurrencies, Honey uses Conviction Voting to allocate common pool resources towards a broader range of contributions. 

By rewarding contributions to 1Hive we hope to grow the size and influence of the community, which would result in broader adoption and increased value of the Honey currency, and ultimately help us all work towards a better future together.
