title: "Understanding the implications of sufficient decentralization"
---

For communities associated with [[crypto currencies]], decentralization is an important factor in how the asset is likely to be regulated. A sufficiently decentralized asset is unlikely to be considered a security, because there isn't a centralized entity that a purchaser could reasonably expect to carry out essential managerial efforts. 

The concept was introduced by William Hinman when he was working at the SEC and is generally cited as the reason why Ether and Bitcoin are generally understood to not be securities. 

So what are the implications of a cryptocurrency community being sufficiently decentralized:

1. **There is no core team** - There may be any number of teams working within the community, but none of them have direct authority over the assets implementation or continued operation.  
2. **There is no single narrative**  - There may be many individuals or groups communicating about the asset, and they may be more or less reputable, but none of them are authoritative. Social consensus determines which narratives ultimately prevail.
