Everyone has different experiences, knowledge, and skills â€“ everyone can add value to 1Hive in one way or another.

We are a community first, contribution can be as simple as starting or joining interesting discussions, reinforcing positive community norms, and otherwise encouraging friendly and engaging interactions with others.

If you are a writer, perhaps you can write something that is interesting or relevant to the community and share it with the community.

If you are developer, perhaps you can contribute to some of our core infrastructure, or if you have your own open source project perhaps you can share it with the community.

If you see something positive in the community, express your gratitude, and consider supporting the effort using Honey.

Keep in mind that all of these contributions are valuable some will be more impactful than others, but even just being present within the community can reinforce positive vibes, its more fun to build things together with the support of a community behind you than it is to build in a vacuum.
