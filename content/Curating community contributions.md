**1Hive is built by its community — and supported by shared resources.**  
We believe that what we value as a community should be reflected in how we allocate those resources.

Whether it’s maintaining infrastructure, supporting contributors, creating tools, writing content, or strengthening community culture — contributions come in many forms. The 1Hive community plays an active role in recognizing and rewarding those efforts using **Honey**, our native currency.

This process is decentralized, flexible, and constantly evolving — but the principle is simple:

> **If something benefits the whole, the community can choose to support it.**

### 🍯 How Community Resources Are Allocated

There are a few key ways the 1Hive community allocates Honey to support work, initiatives, and public goods:

---

### 🐝 Common Pool Proposals (Gardens v1)

The **Common Pool** is a shared treasury governed by the community.  
Anyone can submit a proposal requesting Honey from the pool — whether to fund a new project, support an existing effort, or compensate contributors.

Proposals are discussed in the Forum and voted on using the Gardens v1 interface. Successful proposals receive Honey directly from the Common Pool.

This is the original and most established way 1Hive supports community-led initiatives.

### 🌿 Modular Funding Pools (Gardens v2)

In addition to the Common Pool, we’re experimenting with **Gardens v2**, a modular system that enables new types of funding mechanisms. These include:

- **Contributor Streaming Rewards**  
    Continuous or recurring funding for active contributors, distributed over time.
    
- **Treasury Allocations**  
    Sub-groups or projects within 1Hive can manage their own funding pools, allowing more focused governance over specific initiatives.
    

These pools use conviction-based voting to reflect the relative support of the community, with funding decisions updated continuously based on active preferences.

Gardens v2 makes it easier to try new funding models, align incentives, and support work as it happens — not just after the fact.

### 🌼 A Culture of Curation

Curation isn’t just about formal proposals or voting — it’s about attention, appreciation, and trust.  
You can contribute by:

- Highlighting valuable work
    
- Sharing and celebrating community achievements
    
- Supporting initiatives through tipping or direct engagement
    
- Giving thoughtful feedback on proposals
    

Curation is how we ensure the right things get noticed, and the people doing good work feel seen and supported.
