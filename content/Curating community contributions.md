**1Hive is built by its community — and supported by shared resources.**  
We believe that what we value as a community should be reflected in how we allocate those resources.

Whether it’s maintaining infrastructure, supporting contributors, creating tools, writing content, or strengthening community culture — contributions come in many forms. The 1Hive community plays an active role in recognizing and rewarding those efforts using **Honey**, our native currency.

This process is decentralized, flexible, and constantly evolving — but the principle is simple:

> **If something benefits the whole, the community can choose to support it.**

### 🍯 How Community Resources Are Allocated

There are a few key ways the 1Hive community allocates Honey to support work, initiatives, and public goods:

---

### 🐝 1Hive Common Pool 

The **Common Pool** holds Honey, it is refilled via on-going Honey issuance and by community initiatives which generate Honey inflows. Anyone can submit a proposal requesting Honey from the pool — whether to fund a new project, support an existing effort, or compensate contributors.

Proposals are discussed in the Forum and voted on using the [Gardens v1 interface](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x8ccbeab14b5ac4a431fffc39f4bec4089020a155). Successful proposals receive Honey directly from the Common Pool.

This is the original and most established way 1Hive supports community-led initiatives.

### 🌿 Gardens Pools

In addition to the 1Hive Common Pool, we’re experimenting with various conviction voting pools using **Gardens v2**, a modular system for signaling and funding pool creation. Currently there are several active pools that use Honey for governance, some of which have been funded through common pool proposals. 

The following pools are actively being used:

* **[Citizens Registry](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/100/0x71850b7e9ee3f13ab46d67167341e4bdc905eef9/0xe2396fe2169ca026962971d3b2e373ba925b6257/5)** - This signaling pool is used to manage the allowlist in 1Hive's garden v2 community. Many of the gardens v2 pools require being on that list to participate, simply create a proposal for yourself and share it in the discord. The council safe will then add you to the allowlist. 
- [**Contributor Rewards**](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/100/0x71850b7e9ee3f13ab46d67167341e4bdc905eef9/0xe2396fe2169ca026962971d3b2e373ba925b6257/12) - The council safe managed streaming Honey rewards using superfluid to contributors based on the support they receive in this signaling pool, the rewards are funded by periodic common pool proposals. Everyone who is actively engaged in the 1Hive community is encouraged to create a proposal here, and also to actively participate in recognized and rewarding the efforts of their peers. 
- **[Honey Liquidity Tap](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/100/0x71850b7e9ee3f13ab46d67167341e4bdc905eef9/0xe2396fe2169ca026962971d3b2e373ba925b6257/27)** - This pool is used to fund shared liquidity proposals. Proposers will request Honey to the council safe and provide an equivalent value of their own tokens to be joined together as a liquidity pool. Honey is used to vote on which proposals should be approved. The council safe manages custody of these liquidity pools and some restrictions apply. This pool is funded by periodically requesting Honey from the common pool. 
- [**Council Safe Continuous Election**](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/100/0x71850b7e9ee3f13ab46d67167341e4bdc905eef9/0xe2396fe2169ca026962971d3b2e373ba925b6257/6) - This signaling pool is used to request and vote on membership to the council safe.

### 🌼 A Culture of Curation

Curation isn’t just about formal proposals or voting — it’s about attention, appreciation, and trust.  

You can contribute by:

- Highlighting valuable work
- Sharing and celebrating community achievements
- Supporting initiatives through tipping or direct engagement
- Giving thoughtful feedback on proposals

Curation is how we ensure the right things get noticed, and the people doing good work feel seen and supported.
