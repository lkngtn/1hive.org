1Hive is supported by a range of tools, protocols, and platforms that help us coordinate, govern, and sustain the ecosystem. From managing Honey and proposals to resolving disputes and tracking treasury activity, these systems form the backbone of how 1Hive operates.

This page serves as an **index of key infrastructure and resources**, helping you explore and understand the mechanisms behind 1Hive’s community-led economy.

Below, you’ll find links to tools, documentation, and guides that cover the most important components of our infrastructure.
