1Hive is already sufficiently decentralized, so our vision may differ from the vision of other contributors. However, we believe its imperative that we all share our vision of 1Hive in order to signal our intention for the community and more effectively coordinate efforts to create value for the community. 

Our vision:

Honey is a coordination protocol and a cryptocurrency focused on incentivizing the contribution of public goods related to the successful development and mass adoption of Honey and as means to help humanity successfully navigate the existential risks and unimaginable rewards that await us all as the technological singularity approaches.

Participating in the Honey economy should be rewarding enough that 1Hive can bootstrap itself and snowball its community into a significant contributor of public research, development, and media that will help ensure that there is broadly inclusive public benefit from rapidly accelerating technological progress. 

Holding and using Honey should eventually be accessible and attractive enough that everyone is likely to participate in the Honey economy in one way or another, this way the community will have sufficient leverage to help influence global politics and thereby help humanity successfully navigate the technical singularity collectively as 1Hive.
