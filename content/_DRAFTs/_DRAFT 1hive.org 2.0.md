The 1Hive DAO is hard to explain. We'd like to start doing a better job. Therefore moving forward 1Hive LLC will be using the 1hive.org domain as a place to share our vision for the 1Hive DAO and communicate our views to the 1hive community. We want to more clearly articulate our role as a member of the 1Hive community and what our business model is. 

1Hive.org will be structured as a mind garden. The source code will be available on Github where pull requests may be accepted according to our community guidelines. 1Hive LLC will be the primary contributor and maintainer of the website. 

There will be weekly calls where we will answer questions about the project and make edits to the mind garden which you can participate by becoming an acolyte in the cult of 1hive.
