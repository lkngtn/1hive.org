title: "How you can contribute to 1Hive regardless of skill or talent"
---
If you’ve got this far, and are thinking to yourself, “Wow this sounds amazing, but also a bit confusing, where do I even start?” — That’s okay, and to be expected. 1Hive is dynamic and constantly changing. It can be chaotic and difficult to keep track of everything that is going on, even for the most consistent contributors. To help new bees find their way through 1Hive for the first time here are some resources to help you get started.

 1. Read the [[1Hive community covenant]] - this is like our constitution and sets expectation for how we interact with one another.
 2. Join the [[The cult of 1Hive discord server]]  - this is the primary place for synchronous coordination and discussions among community members. 
 3. Join the [forum](https://forum.1hive.org) - this is where you can find longer form, more asynchronous discussions, its also where proposals that allocate [[Honey is money|honey]] from the common pool are discussed.
 4. Participate in [[An overview of the 1Hive protocol|1Hive DAO]] governance!

You don't need specific skills or talents to contribute. Simply starting and joining discussions within these spaces, helping create positive experiences for others by engaging with them, and sharing your ideas with the community can help make 1Hive a more vibrant and exciting place.

Of course if you do have a special talent or skill, these places are a good way to get ideas for how you can use your skills to contribute, get feedback from peers, and to connect with other people who may have complimentary skills and want to collaborate with you.
