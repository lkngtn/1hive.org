Whether you're here to learn, build, contribute, speculate, or just hang out — you're welcome in the hive.

1Hive is an open community, and there are many ways to get involved. We organize across a few core spaces, each with its own purpose. Here’s a quick overview to help you get oriented:

---

### 💬 Discord – Real-Time Community Hub

Our Discord server is where most day-to-day conversations happen.  
You’ll find:

- General discussion
- Working groups (called “swarms”)
- Real-time help and support
- Coordination on ongoing initiatives

Jump in, introduce yourself, and don’t be shy — we’re friendly.

### 🐝 Honey Governance – How We Make Decisions

Honey is governed by the community — and we use several tools to coordinate how it's used:

- **Gardens v1** – Our main governance interface for voting on proposals and allocating Honey from the Common Pool.

- **Celeste** – A decentralized dispute resolution protocol that helps enforce proposal rules and mediate challenges.

- **Gardens v2** – A newer, modular platform for experimenting with conviction-based governance which we are using to experiment with different ways of allocating Honey. 

We'll be adding guides soon to help you understand and participate in each of these systems.
