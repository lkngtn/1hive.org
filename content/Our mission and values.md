**1Hive is a community of activists seeking to build a future that is more free, fair, open, and humane.**

This guiding vision informs how we work, what we build, and the economic systems we support. But what do we actually mean by _free_, _fair_, _open_, and _humane_?

---
### 🕊 Free

We support systems that expand personal and collective autonomy.  
A free future is one where individuals can make meaningful choices — about how they live, work, and contribute — without coercion or gatekeeping. We value voluntary participation, self-governance, and the freedom to fork, exit, or build alternatives.

---
### ⚖ Fair

We aim to reduce structural advantages and create more equitable starting conditions.  
A fair future is not one where everyone gets the same outcome, but one where rules are transparent, contributions are recognized, and people have a real shot at shaping their own path. We seek to align incentives so that individual success can reinforce collective well-being.

---
### 🌐 Open

We build in public, with transparency and accessibility in mind.  
An open future is one where knowledge, tools, and governance processes are accessible to anyone who wants to participate. Open systems invite diversity, foster trust, and allow ideas to evolve through collaboration and iteration.

---
### 💛 Humane

We prioritize empathy, cooperation, and community well-being.  
A humane future is one where technology and markets serve people — not the other way around. We believe that economic coordination can be designed to encourage kindness, reduce harm, and promote long-term stewardship of shared resources.

---

These values are not slogans — they are design principles.  

They inform how we structure economic incentives, how we govern ourselves, and how we grow 1Hive. By issuing and experimenting with **Honey**, we aim to support regenerative public goods, encourage pro-social contributions, and explore new models of decentralized coordination.

If this vision resonates with you, you’re in the right place.
