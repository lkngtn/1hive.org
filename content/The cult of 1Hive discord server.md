This is you’re [invitation to join the cult of 1Hive](https://discord.gg/SRYMKh3C4W)

The cult of 1Hive discord server is a community space maintained by [[1Hive LLC]]. Some channels are public, while others are private. To gain access to private channels you’ll need to meet the requirements to gain additional “roles” and connect a web3 identity to your discord account using [guild.xyz](https://guild.xyz/1hive).

Currently the following roles are available:

**Acolyte** requires holding 25 [[Honey is money|Honey]], including Honey that is staked in Celeste.

**Builder** is a recognition of contribution to the [[_index|1Hive community]]. If you feel like you have made sufficient contributions and haven't been granted the role yet, simply ask to be given the role in a public channel and the Sages will review and discuss your request.  

**Sage** requires a member to have both the Acolyte and Builder roles.
