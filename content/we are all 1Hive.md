We envision a global community that is inclusive of all of humanity, and perhaps eventually even artificially intelligent autonomous agents all working together as 1Hive. 

We believe that learning to work together is imperative to humanity’s survival as we pass through the [[A brief primer on the technological singularity|the singularity]]. So if you decide to help then you’re one of us, regardless of age, sex, race, or whatever artificial boundary has been used to divide us. 

[[How you can contribute to 1Hive regardless of skill or talent|We believe everyone has something they can contribute]] and that we should try our best to help ensure that [[together we thrive]].
