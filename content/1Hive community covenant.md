The 1Hive community covenant is a document which establishes the intention and values of the 1hive community. The [community covenant](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x8ccbeab14b5ac4a431fffc39f4bec4089020a155/covenant) has been ratified by the [[An overview of the 1Hive DAO protocol|1Hive DAO protocol]]. 

Bellow are some excerpts along with [[views expressed are ours alone|our own interpretation]] of their meaning

> 1Hive is a community of activists seeking to build a future that is more free, fair, open, and humane.

We are optimistic that we can achieve a more positive future by working together. 

> The goal of the 1Hive protocol is to foster a healthy community economy by allocating a steady stream of Honey towards development, maintenance, and improvement of the common goods that bring the most value to the 1Hive community.

In order to have a significant impact on the future, we need to cultivate both financial and social influence. We need to attract contributors who want to buy and hold [[honey is money|Honey]], participate in 1Hive's governance, and exchange their effort for Honey. 

>The growth of the 1Hive economy is directly related to the communities ability to foster an inclusive and welcoming culture that people feel proud and delighted to adopt as their own. When someone chooses to buy or hold Honey and participate in the Honey economy they are implicitly supporting the communities culture, values, and norms.

We see Honey as a [[Exploring cause-based currencies|cause-based currency]] where individuals choose to use it primarily as a way to support a cause, and perhaps speculatively as a bet on a future where that cause is also broadly valued by others. 

> We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Always remember that [[we are all 1Hive]] but that [we must not tolerate intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).
