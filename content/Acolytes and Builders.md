Every cryptocurrency community has two fundamental roles, acolytes and builders. 

Acolytes hold the cryptocurrency and share their vision for the community, they have a vision and their conviction helps guide the community towards the realization of that vision. They may see themselves as patrons, or investors, stakeholders. 

Builders develop the social and technical infrastructure that the cryptocurrency community requires. They may be protocol or application developers, community organizers, content creators, or project managers. 

A successful cryptocurrency community requires both acolytes and builders.
