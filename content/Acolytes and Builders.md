Every cryptocurrency community has two fundamental roles, acolytes and builders. 

Acolytes hold the cryptocurrency and share their vision for the community, they have a vision and their conviction helps guide the community towards the realization of that vision. They may see themselves as patrons, investors, or simply stakeholders. 

Builders develop the social and technical infrastructure that the cryptocurrency community requires. They may be protocol or application developers, community organizers, content creators, project managers, or have some other skill or talent that they can contribute. 

A successful cryptocurrency community requires both acolytes and builders. In 1Hive these roles are more clearly defined than in other communities. Builders may earn protocol rewards for their contributions and Acolytes are responsible for signaling their preferences in order to guide those rewards to the most deserving and ensure that the community as a whole thrives.
