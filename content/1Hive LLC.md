1Hive LLC is a member of [[_index|the 1Hive community]]. We helped launch the [[An overview of the Honey protocol|1hive protocol]]. 1Hive LLC is owned and operated by Luke Duncan. Its primary purpose is to help serve 1Hive by maintaining community spaces, participating in community governance, and communicating our vision for the community.

1Hive LLC currently provides the following community services:
* Maintains [[_index|1hive.org]] as a resource for onboarding community members.  The [[views expressed are ours alone]] and may not always reflect the views of other [[Members of the 1Hive community|members of the 1Hive community]] 
* Host frontend interfaces for interacting with the 1Hive protocol ([gardens](https://gardens.1hive.org) + [celeste](https://celeste.1hive.org/#/dashboard))
