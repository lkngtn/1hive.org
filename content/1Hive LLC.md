1Hive LLC is a member of [[_index|the 1Hive community]]. We helped launch the [[An overview of the 1Hive protocol|1hive protocol]]. 1Hive LLC is owned and operated by Luke Duncan. Its primary purpose is to help serve 1Hive by maintaining community spaces, participating in community governance, and communicating our vision for the community.

1Hive LLC currently provides the following community services:
* Maintains [[_index|1hive.org]] as a resource for onboarding community members. 
  * Share 1Hive LLCâ€™s vision for the 1Hive community

  * Host frontend interfaces for interacting with the 1Hive protocol ([gardens](https://gardens.1hive.org) + [celeste](https://celeste.1hive.org/#/dashboard))

* Maintains [[The cult of 1Hive discord server]] 
  * Administer the discord server, adding channels, roles, and other integrations in order to create an enjoyable and productive synchronous community discussion space

In addition we intend to with other members of the community on the following initiatives: 

* Update the 1Hive community covenant
  * Clarify the shared vision of the 1hive community to enable us to better attract and retain new contributors

* Improve Honey Liquidity with Balancer
  * Develop a liquidity management extension based on fluid proposals and celeste, that allows 1Hive signaling proposals to be used to manage Honey liquidity in a balancer managed pool. 
  * A Streaming proposal is used to allocate honey from the common pool to the liquidity pool allowing community members to vote to increase liquidity. 
  * Signaling proposals are used to add, remove, and adjust the weights of tokens besides Honey in the managed pool.

* Building public infrastructure to support the widespread adoption of conviction currencies like Honey. 
  * Work with other 1Hive community members to create a specification for 1hive protocol v2 
  * Develop and test a reference implementation that can be used to deploy a conviction currency like Honey (along with relevant infrastructure) on any EVM compatible blockchain network 
  * Migrate Honey to 1Hive protocol v2 implementation
